This weekâ€™s lab will show you the basic steps to create and run a C program in Window OS, as shown in Figure 1. Generally, the programs created using programming languages like C, C++, Java etc., are written using high level language like English. But a computer cannot understand high level language. It can understand only low level language. So, the program written in high level language needs to be converted into low level language to make it understandable for a computer. This conversion is performed by using either interpreter or compiler.
