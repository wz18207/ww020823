C allows the programmer to write directly to memory unlike most of other programming languages. 
Key constructs in C such as pointers and arrays are designed to structure and manipulate memory in a machine-independent fashion. 
Thirty two Keywords in C are also called as reserved words such as 
char,
int,
float,
goto
and 
void.
C gives control over the memory layout of data structures! 
Dynamic memory allocation in C is under the control of the programmer unlike languages like Java and Perl that shield the programmer from memory allocation and pointers. 
This can be useful since dealing with memory allocation when building a high-level program is a highly error-prone process. 
C provides a uniform interface when dealing with low-level code such as the part of the OS that controls a device. 
Do these capabilities exist in most other languages?
